*We suggest you to generate all datasets by yourself, as the datasets are too huge to deliver. *

step 1: normalize original midi files: time normalization, key tranformation, etc.


step 2: transform midi files into time-pitch matrices


step 3: analysis chord in midi file: not necessary to re-run the files, all needed files already in this dir


step 4: transform matrices into quadruple sequences: (chroma, octave, velocity, state), the final format


step 5: 


        1) generate datasets for token modeling dataset 
        
        2) token modeling
           **pre-trained models are in pre-trained-models**


step 6: 


        1) transform sequence to bars         
        
        2) transform bars into phrases        
        
        3) generate dataset for context modeling         
        
        4) context modeling and downstream tasks
           **embeddings pre-trained through token modeling are in "embeddings", models fine-tuned by context modeling are in "pre-trained models".**
